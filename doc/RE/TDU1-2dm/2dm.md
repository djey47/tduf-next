### Helper: isHeightmap?
- GOTO 'HASH' subsection of 'MATA' section (hex search)
- GOTO 4bytes (from current)
- READ 4bytes, size2_bytes
- COMPUTE (size2_bytes - 16) / 16, hashes_count
- IF hashes_count != 1 -> isHeightmap false
- GOTO 4bytes (from current)

##Â Meta structure

Here is the meta structure I've seen:

A file mainly contains lists of layer groups, materials, parameters.

- Into list of materials, each one having a hash (name) linked to a material instance further (=> LINK1)

- Material instance has many settings (with most of one unknown), currently supported : alpha (1 byte), saturation (2x 1byte), ambient (4x 4bytes), diffuse(4x 4bytes) , specular(4x 4bytes), other(4x 4bytes)  (4x floating point numbers).  And a material instance has some other parameters stored in other part of the file ( => LINK2)

- Into parameter list, each item has its own shader configuration (64 bytes), which can be retrieved thanks to Speeder source files (World Editor::MaterialPieces.cs). And a link to one of the available layer groups (=> LINK3)

- Each layer group contains an amount of layers (up to 8). Each layer having its name, an optional texture file, 4 obscure settings flags, some animation settings held in another part of the file => LINK4). Sadly, I have not encountered any 2DM file with anim settings yet...

And a variable amount of sub settings, we don't know much about (subId, unk1, unk2, unk3, you noticed on first sampling).
