# Note for TDU2
*Warning! Some files in TDU2 folders are not used! .bpjka may be part of them; actual tire physics are referenced from vehicle database and point to different files*

# TDU1
Those files contain values for Pacejka's formulas - should affect tire physics.

They are packed in a BNK file: *tires.bnk*, there are total 6 profiles, 384 bytes each.
